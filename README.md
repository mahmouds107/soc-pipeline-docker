🚀 My Professional SOC Portfolio & Debugging Journal

Welcome! This repository is the story of my hands-on project building a modern, automated Security Operations Center (SOC) stack from scratch.

This project demonstrates my practical skills in SOAR, IMS, Docker, and advanced Linux/Network Troubleshooting. I didn't just run the code; I debugged it until it worked.

This portfolio is broken down into two parts:

The Technical Architecture: "What I built" - A deep-dive into the tools and the automated workflow.

The Troubleshooting Journal: "How I fixed it" - A log of every major error I faced and the professional process I used to solve them.

🔗 The Code

The final, working docker-compose.yml (The "Golden Blueprint") for this entire stack is located in its own repository:
