# 🚀 My Professional SOC Portfolio & Debugging Journal

Welcome! This repository documents my hands-on journey building a modern, automated **Security Operations Center (SOC)** stack from scratch.

This project showcases my practical skills in **SOAR**, **IMS**, **Docker**, and advanced **Linux/Network Troubleshooting**. I didn't just run the code — I debugged it until it worked perfectly.

## 📂 Project Structure

This portfolio is divided into two main parts:

### 1️⃣ Technical Architecture: *"What I built"*
A deep dive into the tools, components, and automated workflows I implemented.

### 2️⃣ Troubleshooting Journal: *"How I fixed it"*
A detailed log of every major error I encountered and the professional methods I used to resolve them.
